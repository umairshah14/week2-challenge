# My-portfolio-page

## Description
I created this repository to hold my submission for the week 2 challenge which was to create a Portfolio Page to showcase projects that i've done to potential employers

This task helped me further solidify my understandings and knowledge of basic html elements and css classes & id's. In my page i used semantic html elements to create my portfolio

Below is a screenshot of what the project looks like
